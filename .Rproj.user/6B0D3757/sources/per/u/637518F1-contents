```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r covid_2, echo=FALSE}
g + geom_rangeframe() + theme_tufte(base_size = 11, base_family = "serif", ticks = TRUE) +
geom_dl(aes(label = state), method = list(dl.trans(x = x + .2), "last.points", fontsize="8", fontfamily="serif"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r , echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
